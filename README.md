# men-stack-crud-app-project

Starting with the creation of the sign-in and sign-up routes. First thing i'm adding a user schema in models/user.js. 

After that i'm setting my dependencies in server.js and setting the port

Setting the auth.js and the ejs in views/auth. First the basics, so sign-in, sign-up, sign-out and then adding the bcrypt.
